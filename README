This repo is a mirror of the aruco code from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/aruco/

Note that since version 3.1.0 the licensing has been changed from a permissive license to GPLv3,
 and previous versions have been deleted from sourceforge.  In addition the underlying logic code
 has been obsfucated/encrypted.
 
This is the last known version (3.0.13) of permissively licensed, non-obsfucated/encrypted, open code.
 This branch was forked from 3.0.11 (a good complete copy), and then updates applied from an incomplete
 forked repo https://github.com/fnoop/python-aruco.
 
This repo has various bugfixes and updates applied to 3.0.13:
 - Fix and optimize Cortex A8 build for armhf platform (Raspberry)
 - Fix typo that prevents build
 - Convert deprecated OpenCV c-style calls to C++
