This is a mirror of the aruco code from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/aruco/
Note that since version 3.1.0 the licensing has been changed from a permissive license to GPLv3,
 and previous versions have been deleted from sourceforge.  This repo has a release tag v3.0.11
 that contains the permissively licensed code.
